# Thumbnail Assets

Reference images used by the top-level README gallery. Each PNG mirrors a project’s current look and links back to the corresponding project README:

| Image | Linked project |
| --- | --- |
| `th-libdmotservices-01.png` | [libdmotservices](../libdmotservices/README.md) |
| `th-null-cipher-01.png` | [null-cipher](../null-cipher/README.md) |
| `th-slideshow-server-01.png` | [slideshow-server](../slideshow-server/README.md) |
| `th-wifiequ-01.png` | [WiFiEqu](../wifiequ/README.md) |
| `th-pkixwebadm-01.png` | [pkixwebadm](../pkixwebadm/README.md) |
| `th--coming_soon.png` | Placeholder for incubating projects such as [Terraglean](../docs/terraglean.md) |

## Maintenance
- Keep filenames stable so existing Markdown links remain valid.
- Regenerate thumbnails whenever a project UI or branding changes so screenshots stay representative.
- Do **not** add README files to build output folders (`dist/`, etc.); this directory is safe because it contains only static assets tracked in git.
