# libdmotservices-core

Lightweight Java utilities for general-purpose application development.  
Focus areas include I/O, regular expressions, URI manipulation, collections, and time utilities.

## Project Summary
This submodule demonstrates my ability to:
- Develop clean, dependency-free Java APIs.
- Write maintainable codebases that compile on Java 17 and above.
- Separate production and test scopes cleanly.

## Technical Summary
- **Java version:** 17 (`--release 17`)
- **Dependencies:** none (except test scope)
- **Distribution:** published as a simple Maven artifact

## What this demonstrates
- Core Java proficiency.
- Understanding of library design and modular packaging.
- Readable, well-documented code for client-facing environments.

Dependency-light utilities for everyday Java work.
Focus: I/O, URIs, regex helpers, collections, and time (`java.time`) conveniences.
