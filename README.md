# cv-samples

A collection of coding samples to complement my CV.

## Notice

None of the code in this repository has been used in production on client systems.
All examples are small, self-contained pieces of code that I wrote either for personal exploration or as part of my studies.

You can view a few live, interactive samples [here](https://cv-samples.vercel.app).
