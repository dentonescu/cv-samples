# cv-samples

A compact portfolio of small, self‑contained code projects that complement my CV. Each folder contains either a standalone app or a minimal library with examples and tests. The focus is clarity, correctness, and cross‑language thinking.

## About me
I’m a software engineer who enjoys building neat, well‑scoped utilities and visual demos across languages (C, Java, Python, TypeScript/JavaScript, and Angular). I care about readable code, reproducible builds, and pragmatic architecture.

## Projects

| Project | What it is | Primary skills |
|---|---|---|
| **[libdmotservices](libdmotservices/README.md)** | Personal multi‑language utility library with unit tests and examples. | C, Java, Makefile, Unit Testing |
| **[null-cipher](null-cipher/README.md)** | Single‑page visual demo of a simple cipher (encrypt/decrypt) in the browser. | JavaScript, HTML, CSS |
| **[slideshow-server](slideshow-server/README.md)** | Tiny Python web server that generates responsive media slideshows. | Python, HTML, JS |
| **[WiFiEqu](wifiequ/README.md)** (in progress) | Terminal Wi‑Fi channel “equalizer” visualizer with a C JSON daemon, Windows service, and Angular web UI. The Linux daemon streams live/mock readings over SSE, honours configurable refresh cadences, and secures `/api/v1/stats` with an API key. | C, ANSI/terminal, JSON APIs, C#, Angular |
| **[Terraglean](terraglean/README.md)** (planned) | Interactive map showing world data layers (time, weather, country stats). | Java, Spring Boot, Leaflet.js |

## How to use this repository
