# WiFiEqu — Docs

Rendered and generated documentation that complements the source tree.

## Contents

- [API reference](api/README.md) – OpenAPI contract, HTML preview, and screenshots for the HTTP surface.
- [Project overview](../README.md) – Back to the main WiFiEqu entry point.

`make docs` (run from the project root) regenerates the Redoc HTML in `docs/api/index.html`.
