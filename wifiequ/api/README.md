# WiFiEqu (API)

Authoritative contract for the daemon’s HTTP surface.

## Specification
- Source: [`openapi.yaml`](openapi.yaml)
- Pre-rendered docs: [`../docs/api/index.html`](../docs/api/index.html) (generated by the root `make docs` target, which auto-installs `@redocly/cli` when needed)

## Endpoints
- `GET /api/v1/channels` → most recent channel aggregates
- `GET /api/v1/stats` → daemon metadata and config summary
- `GET /api/v1/channels/stream` → Server-Sent Events feed of channel readings

Contract changes should update both the YAML and the generated HTML so clients and ops have a consistent view.

## Status
- Streaming endpoint is tracked in the daemon backlog; the contract is published to unblock consumers early.
- Schema linting and contract tests remain on the roadmap.
