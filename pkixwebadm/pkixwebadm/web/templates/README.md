# Templates

Jinja templates rendered by pkixwebadm.

- `base.html` supplies the HTML skeleton and includes the stylesheet.
- `ROOT.html` extends `base.html` to show project metadata and placeholder copy.

Additional templates (dashboard, certificate detail pages, error states) will live alongside these. Return to the [web README](../README.md) for navigation.
