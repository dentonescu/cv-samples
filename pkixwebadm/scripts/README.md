# Scripts

Utility helpers that support pkixwebadm during local development.

| Script | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `gen_pw.py` | Generates a random bootstrap password and bcrypt hash. Useful when seeding the first admin account; prints environment-variable-friendly key/value pairs. |

Run scripts via `python3 scripts/<name>.py` from the project root so relative imports find the package. Return to the [project README](../README.md) for the broader overview or [NOTES.md](../NOTES.md) for the delivery plan.
