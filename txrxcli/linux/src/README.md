# Dual-Mode Binary

`txrxcli` runs as either client or server based on `--mode client|server`. Both branches print the demo-only warning on startup. Server mode is implemented; client mode is still pending.

## Usage (current)
- Server: `./txrxcli --mode server --port 9000 --key SECRET`
- Client: TODO (stub prints a placeholder message)
