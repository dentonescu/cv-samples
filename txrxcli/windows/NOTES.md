# Windows Development Notes

## Stage
Not started. The focus is currently on the Linux C++ implementation.

## Plan
- Implement C# server using raw TCP with the same framing as the Linux version.
- Implement C# client that speaks the same protocol.
- Maintain the same demo-only safety banner and API-key gate.

## Future work
Add simple usage examples and update the protocol docs once the C++ side stabilizes.
