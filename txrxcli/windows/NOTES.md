# Windows Development Notes

**Navigation:** [Windows README](README.md) · [Project README](../README.md)

## Stage
- Dual-mode .NET app is implemented: server/client mirror the framing, API-key gate, and warning banner.
- Protocol and ProcessRunner have unit tests; integration coverage is still TODO.

## Plan
- Add integration tests for the Windows/.NET client/server (loopback).
- Keep tests green; consider timeouts and clearer error handling for demos.
- Update protocol docs once integration tests land.
- Make sure future screenshots/examples reflect both platforms.

## Future work
Add simple usage examples for Windows/.NET and ensure protocol docs reflect both implementations.
